#textresizer.js

i was looking for a plugin that resizing text on browser resize and with debounce hack added so i just made this. hope you can use it.

To use this just make document ready and then run the function:

    $(function(){
    $text.fitText(15, 120, 20);
    });
    
<b>Explained:</b>

    $text.fitText(textsize, maxsize, minsize);

minsize & maxsize is in pixels

textsize is atm just a size factor you have to resize it to your purpose
